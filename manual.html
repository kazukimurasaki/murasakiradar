  <h1>Welcome to the Murasaki Everywhere Detector System (M.E.D.S)!</h1>
  <p>Yes, the name was on purpose.</p>

  <p>
  Because Blake Izayoi can't lower his guard whenever Kazuki Murasaki's around town, you can help <s>snitch for that bastard</s> warn Blake ahead of time<br>with this state-of-the-art sonar technology (that we definitely didn't pay Nitori cucumbers to create).
  </p>

  <p>
  Now you can pinpoint where the notorious Kazuki Murasaki is and see what no-good mischief he's up to!<br>Go ahead and try it out for yourself!
